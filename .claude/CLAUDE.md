# JESUS Company Strategic Cash Management System ## Project Overview **Purpose**: Strategic financial planning tool for CFO to scale ₱50M → ₱250M revenue **Entities**: YAHSHUA Outsourcing Worldwide Inc, The ABBA Initiative OPC **Stack**: Python 3.11+, Streamlit, Google Sheets API, SQLite/PostgreSQL **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud This is a contract-based multi-year cash projection system with scenario modeling for strategic growth decisions. --- ## Business Rules ### Revenue Model - **Invoice Timing**: 15 days BEFORE the 1st of the month - Example: Invoice on Feb 15 for March billing (due Apr 1) - **Payment Terms**: Net 30 (customers should pay within 30 days of invoice) - **Default Reliability**: 80% (expect payment 10 days LATER than Net 30) - Optimistic scenario: Payment on time (Net 30) - Realistic scenario: Payment 10 days late (Net 30 + 10 days) - **Recurring Revenue**: Use "Monthly Fee" column as the actual recurring amount - **Payment Plans**: Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, Bi-annually, More than 1 year - **Renewal**: Subscriptions renew automatically unless client disengages ### Expense Model **Payroll (Priority 1 - Non-negotiable)**: - Fixed: ₱1M on 15th, ₱1M on 30th of every month - ALWAYS pay first, never delay - Scenario planning: Average ₱40K-60K per employee **Loans (Priority 2 - Contractual)**: - Amortization + Interest payments - Must honor payment schedule - Track principal vs interest separately for P&L **Software/Tech (Priority 3 - Medium flexibility)**: - Typical due date: 21st of month - Can delay 5-10 days if cash tight - Example: AWS, Google Workspace, SaaS tools **Operations (Priority 4 - High flexibility)**: - Categories: Rent, Utilities, Supplies, Meals, Fuel - Can negotiate timing with most vendors - Highest flexibility in cash crunch scenarios ### Entity Assignment **YAHSHUA Outsourcing** = Customers acquired by: - RCBC Partner - Globe Partner - YOWI **ABBA Initiative** = Customers acquired by: - TAI - PEI *(Configurable in `config/entity_mapping.py`)* --- ## Technical Standards ### Code Quality - **Python Version**: 3.11+ required - **Type Hints**: Required for all function signatures ```python def calculate_projection(start: date, end: date) -> List[ProjectionDataPoint]: pass ``` - **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions ```python def calculate_cash_position(inflows: Decimal, outflows: Decimal) -> Decimal: """Calculate ending cash position. Args: inflows: Total revenue received in period outflows: Total expenses paid in period Returns: Ending cash balance (can be negative) """ return starting_cash + inflows - outflows ``` ### Currency Formatting - **ALWAYS**: Philippine Peso (₱) symbol - **ALWAYS**: Comma thousands separator - **ALWAYS**: 2 decimal places **Correct**: ₱2,500,000.00 **Wrong**: 2500000, ₱2500000, ₱2,500,000 ```python from utils.currency_formatter import format_currency amount = Decimal('2500000') display = format_currency(amount) # Returns: ₱2,500,000.00 ``` ### Performance Requirements - **Scenario Recalculation**: <2 seconds - **Dashboard Load**: <3 seconds - **Data Import**: <10 seconds for 500 contracts - **Projection Generation**: <5 seconds for 3-year daily projection (1095 data points) ### Testing Requirements - **Coverage**: 100% on all financial calculation modules - **Test Data**: Use realistic data (1000+ data points for stress testing) - **Edge Cases**: Must test: - Contract gaps (no revenue for period) - Contract renewals (mid-projection expiration) - Negative cash scenarios - Multi-entity isolation (YAHSHUA data doesn't leak into ABBA) - Scenario accuracy (hiring/expense/revenue changes apply correctly) - Currency rounding (no precision errors) ```python # Example test structure def test_payroll_always_2m_per_month(): """Payroll must be exactly ₱2M per month (₱1M on 15th + ₱1M on 30th).""" projection = calculate_projection('2026-01-01', '2026-12-31', 'YAHSHUA') for month_data in group_by_month(projection): payroll_total = sum(p.outflows for p in month_data if p.category == 'Payroll') assert payroll_total == Decimal('2000000.00'), \ f"Payroll must be ₱2M per month, got ₱{payroll_total:,.2f}" ``` --- ## Development Workflow ### Git Worktrees (Parallel Development) Use Git worktrees to enable 3 simultaneous development sessions without switching branches. ```bash # Main worktree (backend development) cd jesus-company-cash-management # Create worktree for frontend development git worktree add ../cash-mgmt-frontend frontend-dashboard # Create worktree for testing git worktree add ../cash-mgmt-testing feature-tests # Now you can work in 3 terminal sessions simultaneously: # Session 1: Backend in main directory # Session 2: Frontend in ../cash-mgmt-frontend # Session 3: Testing in ../cash-mgmt-testing ``` ### Commit Standards - **Frequency**: Commit after each logical unit of work (every 30-60 minutes) - **Messages**: Descriptive and specific - Good: "Implement realistic payment delay (10-day lag) in projection engine" - Bad: "Update projections" ### Test-Driven Development 1. Write test first 2. Run test (should fail) 3. Write minimal code to pass test 4. Refactor 5. Repeat ### Auto-Testing Hooks ```bash # Set up pre-commit hook to run tests echo "pytest tests/" > .git/hooks/pre-commit chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit ``` --- ## Deployment ### Environment Variables ```bash # Never commit these to git GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDS_PATH=/path/to/credentials.json SPREADSHEET_ID=1abc123xyz... SECRET_KEY=random_secret_for_sessions DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///jesus_cash_management.db # or PostgreSQL URL ``` ### Streamlit Cloud Deployment 1. Push to GitHub repository 2. Connect repository in Streamlit Cloud 3. Add environment variables in Streamlit Cloud dashboard 4. Deploy ### Security Checklist - ✅ Google Sheets credentials in environment variables (not in code) - ✅ User passwords hashed with bcrypt - ✅ Session secret key in environment variables - ✅ No sensitive data in Git history - ✅ `.env` file in `.gitignore` --- ## Never Do (Critical Don'ts) 1. **DON'T start Streamlit server automatically** - CFO runs manually: `streamlit run dashboard/app.py` - Don't add `if __name__ == '__main__': streamlit.run()` 2. **DON'T guess at entity assignments** - Always use config/entity_mapping.py - Raise error if acquisition source is unmapped 3. **DON'T deploy without tests passing** - Run `pytest tests/` before every deployment - CI/CD should block deployment if tests fail 4. **DON'T modify projection formulas without CFO approval** - Financial calculations are sacred - Document any formula changes in CHANGELOG.md 5. **DON'T expose raw numbers without ₱ formatting** - Every currency display must use format_currency() - No naked Decimals in dashboard 6. **DON'T write back to Google Sheets** - Read-only access to preserve source of truth - All edits happen in dashboard → save to local DB --- ## Biblical Principle > **"Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?"** > — Luke 14:28 This tool helps CFO Mich "count the cost" of growth decisions: - Can we afford to hire 10 employees? - What revenue do we need to partner with CyTech? - When can we invest ₱10M in a new office? Financial planning is stewardship. This system enables wise stewardship of ₱50M → ₱250M growth. --- ## Quick Reference ### Running the Application ```bash # Install dependencies pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages # Run tests pytest tests/ -v # Run dashboard streamlit run dashboard/app.py # Sync data from Google Sheets python -c "from data_processing.google_sheets_import import sync_all_data; sync_all_data()" ``` ### Common Tasks **Add a new scenario**: 1.
